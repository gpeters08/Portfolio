    <h2>Dear <span data-fill="company"></span> Hiring Team,</h2>

    <p>
      I am writing to formally express my interest in the <strong><span data-fill="role"></span></strong> position at <strong><span data-fill="company"></span></strong>. 
      In my current position at Live! Casino Pittsburgh as a <strong>Revenue Auditor</strong>, I have gained valuable experience analyzing financial data, reconciling transactions,
       and preparing regulatory reports. This role has allowed me to develop a strong foundation in <em>data analysis, reporting, and compliance</em> while working within high-volume casino operations. 
       Beyond these technical skills, I have developed a true passion for contributing to the casino and gambling industry. I am eager to continue growing my career in this field and hope to expand my 
       impact by supporting broader business decisions and contributing to <span data-fill="company"></span>â€™s ongoing success.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In addition to my auditing responsibilties, I have been actively developing my skills in data analysis
      through my coursework at <strong>Western Governors University</strong>, where I am pursuing a
      <strong>Bachelor of Science in Data Analytics</strong>. My projects have included working with <em>SQL databases</em> to
      extract and join datasets, using <em>Python</em> for data wrangling and visualization, and building interactive dashboards
      in <em>Power BI</em>. These experiences have strengthened my ability to analyze complex data, identify patterns, and
      translate findings into actionable insightsâ€”skills directly relevant to the <strong><span data-fill="role"></span></strong>
      position.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Beyond my formal coursework, I have completed several data analysis projects that reflect both technical ability and practical application. 
      For example, I built a <a href="projects/Subway Final Project.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>sales forecasting model</strong></a> in R Studio to compare unit differences between Subway restaurant locations, 
      conducted a <a href="projects/Titanic Final Project.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>logistic regression analysis</strong></a> to evaluate survival factors in the Titanic dataset, 
      and performed a <a href="projects/Best Cookie Analysis.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>one-way ANOVA study</strong></a> on cookie recipes to evaluate how ingredient variations affected texture and identify the optimal combination.
      In Python, I developed a <a href="projects/Bike Explanatory.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>bike-sharing explanatory analysis</strong></a> to examine ridership patterns, 
      which led to <a href="projects/Bike Exploratory.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>bike-sharing exploratory analysis</strong></a> to uncover trends in trip duration and demographics. I created a <a href="projects/Movie Revenue Analysis.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>movie revenue analysis</strong></a> to determine the key drivers of box office performance. 
      Additionally, within my current role, I built an <mark>Excel-based variance alert system</mark> for slot progressives that uses conditional formatting to flag liabilities over $4,000 in real time.
    </p>

    <hr />
    <p>
      Combining my academic training with my hands-on experience at <span data-fill="company"></span> has allowed me to develop both
      the technical and practical perspectives needed to succeed in this role. I am confident that this blend of skills positions me
      to contribute not only accurate analyses, but also meaningful recommendations that support strategic decision-making.
    </p>

      <p><strong>Sincerely,</strong><br />Garrett Peters</p>
